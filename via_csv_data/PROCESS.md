1. Run the data logger via battery power.
2. When you use the data logging feature on the micro:bit V2, a HTML file is created on the `MICROBIT` drive called `MY_DATA` that lets you interact with the logged data.
3. View `MY_DATA` in your browser. The page displays a set of buttons to interact with the data and a table containing the data that has been logged so far.
4. Click the <kbd>Download</kbd> button. This downloads the data in `.csv` format using a period `.` as the delimiter.
5. Run the `/not_connected/visualiser.py` script and follow any instructions that appear on screen.
